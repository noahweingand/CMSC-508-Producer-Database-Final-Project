### To do
* sanitize inputs?

    * search so far: producer, artist, all
        * Still need: song, tag, tools
* Login
    * login form needs to be hit first and then pass state of logged in
* DB  
    * Remove email for producers/artists from db? Probably don't need it
    * FILL DAT BITCH NO CAP ðŸ˜‚
* Add 
    * add DOB as field
* Producer Page
    * styling
* Alex's List of things to do: 
    * Make procedure to insert credit link to songs so that we don't have a wild query on front end
    * Finish important inserts
    * Possibly make a trigger or something that won't allow inserts to the users table
    * Add functionality to update song reference to artist / producer
    * make on update cascades and on delete cascades
    * consider adding boolean admin attribute to users table so only admins can delete a producer
    * consider option if someone wants to add more credits to a specific song
    * procedure for adding daws to a producer
